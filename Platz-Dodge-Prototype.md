# Platz-Dodge-Prototype

**A prototype**; 

**Not playable;**

**But runnable;**

- It's a horizontal endless dodging game inspired by raylib game examples Space Invaders and Dr. turtle & Mr. gamera.
- We took some snippets from both of the games and redesign it.
- Expect the finished project on January.
