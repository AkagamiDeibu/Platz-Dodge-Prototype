# Platz-Dodge-Prototype

- It's a horizontal endless dodging game inspired by raylib game examples Space Invaders and Dr. turtle & Mr. gamera. You can download and play it, just make sure that you have raylib installed on your computer.
- We took some snippets from both of the games and redesign it.
